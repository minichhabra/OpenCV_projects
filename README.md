# OpenCV projects
1) Virtual pen- openCV project involving detection,tracking and drawing of coloured object with the help of contour detection
2) Rock Paper Scissors - A fun deep learning based implementation of the age of game of Rock Paper Scissors.
3) Face recording and detection- Recording the faces and identifiying them by means of KNN classifiers.
4) Social Distancing - Due to the present unfortunate circumstances social distancing has become very important.
This simple OpenCV project helps to detect faces using Haar Cascades and then finding the distance between them and checking whether social distancing norms are followed. This project can be extended to full body detection.
5)Eye Blink Detection
6)Invisible cloak of Harry Potter
